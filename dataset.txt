1. Face-Detection-Dataset
The dataset comprises 16.7k images and 2 annotation files, each in a distinct format. The first file, labeled "Label," contains annotations with the original scale, while the second file, named "yolo_format_labels," contains annotations in YOLO format. The dataset was obtained by employing the OIDv4 toolkit, specifically designed for scraping data from Google Open Images. Notably, this dataset exclusively focuses on face detection.
This dataset offers a highly suitable resource for training deep learning models specifically designed for face detection tasks. The images within the dataset exhibit exceptional quality and have been meticulously annotated with bounding boxes encompassing the facial regions. The annotations are provided in two formats: the original scale, denoting the pixel coordinates of the bounding boxes, and the YOLO format, representing the bounding box coordinates in normalized form.
The dataset was meticulously curated by scraping relevant images from Google Open Images through the use of the OIDv4 toolkit. Only images that are pertinent to face detection tasks have been included in this dataset. Consequently, it serves as an ideal choice for training deep learning models that specifically target face detection tasks.

2. Dark Face Dataset

The Dark Face dataset provides 6,000 real-world low light images captured during the nighttime, at teaching buildings, streets, bridges, overpasses, parks, etc., all labeled with bounding boxes for of human face, as the main training and/or validation sets. We also provide 9,000 unlabeled low-light images collected from the same setting. Additionally, we provided a unique set of 789 paired low-light/normal-light images captured in controllable real lighting conditions (but unnecessarily containing faces), which can be used as parts of the training data at the participants' discretization. There will be a hold-out testing set of 4,000 low-light images, with human face bounding boxes annotated.
